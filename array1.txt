    //  Array : storing of homogeneous data type in a continuous memory location
    // continous memory allocation : 
    The array elements are stored back-to-back in memory without gaps.
If the base address of the array is 1000 (the memory address of the first element), and the size of each element is 4 bytes (for example, an int), the memory layout will look like:
Element 1: Address 1000
Element 2: Address 1004 (1000 + 4)
Element 3: Address 1008 (1004 + 4), and so on
    // let ar = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
    // document.write(ar);
     let ar = new Array (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9);
     let x = ar.at(3);
     document.write(x);
    // document.write(ar);
